## About

**Designed Decor** is a feature-focused add-on for the [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) mod, built specifically for players and modpack makers who want **rich decorative content without jumping to Create 0.6**. 

This mod expands the creative possibilities of your factory and industrial builds by introducing a curated selection of themed blocks, items, and recipes that fit naturally into the Create 0.5.x ecosystem.

With Designed Decor, you can:
- Craft immersive industrial environments with new **materials** like cardboard sheets and sawdust.
- Add **factory realism** with new crafting chains.
- Equip your workers with a **bright orange safety vest** and hard hats.
- Enjoy seamless integration with Create‚Äôs survival mechanics.

Lightweight, lore-friendly, and **perfect for survival or modpack playthroughs**.
